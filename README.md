## [optional] Setup VirtualBox
I'd recommend following all sections below on a VM for your first time before doing anything on 'real' hardware. You can iterate faster and learning without breaking your own üí©.

<details><summary><span style="font-weight:bold">CLICK HERE</span> to Setup VirtualBox</summary><p>

### Install VirtualBox
1. Download and install [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
    ``` sh
    brew cask install virtualbox
    ```
### Create a new VM
1. Launch VirtualBox, click `New`:</br></br>**Type:** `Linux`</br>**Version:** `Ubuntu (64-bit)`
    ![](assets/vb-new.png)
1. Continue with defaults (which should include a **10 GB** virtual drive)

### Configure and Launch new VM
1. Select VM from step above and click `Settings`
2. Navigate to **System > Motherboard** 
3. Check `Enable EFI (special OSes only)`
    ![](assets/vb-mobo.png)
4. Navigate to **Storage** and attach `ubuntu-20.04-desktop-amd64.iso` as a new Optical Drive:
    ![](assets/vb-storage.png)
5. Navigate to **Network** and change to `Bridged Adapter` so the VM will get an IP Address from your router instead of your computer:
    ![](assets/vb-bridged.png)
6. [optional] Increase VM performance 
   > I put my numbers below but do what suites you
   
   **Base Memory:** `2048 MB`</br>**Processor(s)** `4`</br>**Video Memory:** `128 MB`
7. Click `OK` to save settings
8. Click `Start`
9.  [optional] Change VM to Scaled Mode (View > Scaled Mode) for a better viewing experience
10. You should be off to the races üèá</br>

## Install Ubuntu 20.04 on BTRFS with LUKS
By the end of this section you should have a bare bones Ubuntu system up and running on BTRFS with LUKS. It will be a little rough around the edges (like manually running commands locally to get past LUKS and boot) but it's a start!

<details><summary><span style="font-weight:bold">CLICK HERE</span>  to Install Ubuntu 20.04 on BTRFS with LUKS</summary>
<p>

<p align="center"><img src="assets/letsdothis.png"/></p>

### Download Ubuntu 20.04 LTS image
[https://releases.ubuntu.com/20.04/ubuntu-20.04-desktop-amd64.iso](https://releases.ubuntu.com/20.04/ubuntu-20.04-desktop-amd64.iso)
### Launch 'Try Ubuntu' from Installer USB/CD
1. If you are not going the VirtualBox VM route you will need to [build an Ubuntu Live USB](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/tutorial-create-a-usb-stick-on-ubuntu) from `ubuntu-20.04-desktop-amd64.iso` and launch into it.
2. Start your system, boot to the attached Ubuntu environment, and select `Try Ubuntu` once fully loaded.
3. Open `terminal` (Ctrl+Opt+T on macOS) and run `lsblk` to list out your block devices and locate the drive you will be installing Ubuntu on ‚Äì in my case `sda`.</br>
![](assets/vb-lsblk.png)
    > Jot down your disk name, if it's different than mine, and use it for the remainder of this guide
4. Launch interactive sudo `sudo -i` in terminal ‚Äì it's time to get our hands dirty üôå.

### Create Disk Partitions
1. Launch `parted` in interactive sudo to setup a `GPT` partition table and create our three partitions: `EFI`, `/boot`, and `/`.</br>
    ``` sh
    parted /dev/sda
        mklabel gpt
        mkpart primary 1MiB 513MiB
        mkpart primary 513MiB 1026MiB
        mkpart primary 1026MiB 100%
        print
        quit
    ```

    ![](assets/parted.png)

    > If you dont have a UEFI system (BIOS, like myself) then you will need to do something slightly different for the first partition:
    > ``` sh
    > parted /dev/sda
    >   mklabel gpt
    >    mkpart primary 1MiB 2MiB
    >    set 1 bios_grub on
    >    mkpart primary 2MiB 514MiB
    >    mkpart primary 514MiB 100%
    >    print
    >    quit
    >    ```

### Setup LUKS Disk Encryption on `/` partition
1. Setup encryption on `/` partition:
    ``` sh
    cryptsetup luksFormat /dev/sda3
    ```
    > **Use a strong passphrase**: This passphrase is what will be used to unlock your disk encryption in the future ‚Äì¬†avoid brute force attacks and use something long and strong üòò.
    
    > If you on on VirtualBox, you may get a `Killed` response with a screen flicker, this means luksFormat failed. Try with `--pbkdf-memory 256` to reduce the required memory ‚Äì not recommended if you can avoid it. 
2. Open your newly created LUKS `/` partition:
   ``` sh
   cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sda3 sda3_crypt
   ```
   > This will mount an LVM at `/dev/mapper/sda3_crypt` which is affectively your decrypted partition.

### Format Disk Partitions
1. Format `EFI` partition:
    ``` sh
    mkfs.vfat -F 32 /dev/sda1
    ```
    > Skip this if you are going the BIOS route.
2. Format `/boot` partition:
    ``` sh
    mkfs.btrfs /dev/sda2
    ```
1. Format `/` partition:
    ``` sh
    mkfs.btrfs /dev/mapper/sda3_crypt
    ```
    > You do not want to use `/dev/sda3` here because it's encrypted.

### Install Ubuntu üë®‚Äçüíª
1. Launch Ubuntu Installer from interactive sudo terminal
   ``` sh
   ubiquity
   ```
   ![](assets/installer.png)
2. Continue with your desired settings until you hit the **Installation type** page, here you want to select the `Something else` radial button:
    ![](assets/installtype.png)
3. We are now going to tell the Ubuntu installer how/where we want our installation:
    1. Select `/dev/sda1`, press the Change button. Choose Use as `EFI System Partition`.</br>
        > If this is not an option, you probably didn't boot with UEFI Support in VirtualBox or your System doesnt support UEFI üôÅ and you will need to go with a BIOS option as discussed above.
    2. Select `/dev/sda2`, press the Change button. Choose Use as `btrfs journaling filesystem`, check `Format`, and use `/boot` as Mount point.
    3. Select `/dev/mapper/sda3_crypt`, press the Change button. Choose Use as `btrfs journaling filesystem`, check `Format`, and use `/` as Mount point.
   
    ![](assets/installtypeparts.png)
4. Click `Install Now`
5. Continue through the rest of the installation with your desired settings:
    ![](assets/installcomplete.png)
6. Remove the Ubuntu Installer USB/CD ‚Äì it is no longer needed.
7.  Click `Restart Now`
8.  Congrats, Ubuntu is installed on BTRFS with LUKS üéâ ‚Äì time for a test drive to see if it works üöô...

### Launch your new Ubuntu System for the First Time
1. Once booted/restarted you should end up in `initramfs` running `BusyBox` and not Ubuntu. This is because your `/boot` volume could not mount the `/` partition because it's encrypted:
    ![](assets/initramfs.png)
2. Perform the following commands to boot into Ubuntu:
   1. Open the encrypted `/` partition
       ``` sh
       cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sda3 sda3_crypt
       ```
   2. Scan for the `/` partition filesystem
       ``` sh
       btrfs device scan
       ```
   3. Exit to continue the booting process
       ``` sh
       exit
       ```
    ![](assets/manualboot.png)
3. If all's good, you should be loaded to Ubuntu!</br>
![](assets/booted.png)

### Enable SSH
1. Upgrade packages, install a couple more, and enable ssh access:
    ``` sh
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt upgrade -y
    sudo apt install -y net-tools openssh-server curl vim
    ```
2. Add filewall rule for ssh:
    ``` sh
    sudo ufw allow ssh
    ```
3. Setup `authorized_keys` to gate ssh access:
    ``` sh
    mkdir ~/.ssh
    echo "YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY_HERE" >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
    ```
    > Read more about [ssh-keygen](https://www.ssh.com/ssh/keygen/) if needed.
4. You should now be able to ssh into your Ubuntu system:
    ``` sh
    ssh binaryshrub@192.168.1.109
    ```
    > Use `ifconfig` if you need to find the IP Address.

### Additional Configuration
1. [optional] If you are on VirtualBox, you should now install `VirtualBox Guest Additions` and `disable Scaled Mode` to make your experience better.
2. [optional] Trim down on GRUB start time from `30s` to `2s` like default</br>
    ``` sh
    sudo sh -c 'echo GRUB_RECORDFAIL_TIMEOUT=2 >> /etc/default/grub'
    sudo update-grub
    ```

## Configure `/boot` SSH Client with Dropbear for Remote Unlock

In this section you will be setting up a helper script and an SSH Client that is put inside `initramfs` which is called by GRUB when booting. This will allow you to remotely unlock your encrypted partitions üëè (via ssh) to ensure a display-less experience even on reboot or power on üéâ.

<details><summary><span style="font-weight:bold">CLICK HERE</span> to Configure /boot SSH Client with Dropbear for Remote Unlock</summary><p>

### Download and Execute `btrfs-luks-unlocker.sh`

The following script will setup the ssh client for you, add an `unlock` script, and grant access to `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`:
``` sh
cd ~
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BinaryShrub/ubuntu-btrfs-luks/master/scripts/btrfs-luks-unlocker.sh -o btrfs-luks-unlocker.sh
sudo chmod +x btrfs-luks-unlocker.sh
./btrfs-luks-unlocker.sh
```
> WARNING: You will need to rerun this script on `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` change if you want the new users to have access to connect.

> WARNING: You will need to update `btrfs-luks-unlocker.sh` to include all drives that should be unlocked. Look for the line with `cryptsetup luksOpen` and change/duplicate accordingly.

### Reboot and SSH into `/boot`
After this script has executed, you should now be able to ssh into the system on reboot. To do this you must explicitly use the `root` user like so:
``` sh
ssh root@192.168.1.109
```
> Do not change user, `root` is what you want.

### Execute `unlock` when in initramfs
Once you have successfully connected to initramfs (from the step above) you will now have access to the `unlock` script to help make unlocking easier for you:

``` sh
ssh root@192.168.1.109


BusyBox v1.30.1 (Ubuntu 1:1.30.1-4ubuntu6) built-in shell (ash)
Enter 'help' for a list of built-in commands.

# unlock
Enter passphrase for /dev/sda3: 
Scanning for Btrfs filesystems

‚è≥ Booting ...

# Connection to 192.168.1.109 closed by remote host.
Connection to 192.168.1.109 closed.
```

You can also access this script with `./unlock` to make it easier to remember if you forget üòá:
``` sh
ssh root@192.168.1.109       


BusyBox v1.30.1 (Ubuntu 1:1.30.1-4ubuntu6) built-in shell (ash)
Enter 'help' for a list of built-in commands.

# ls
unlock
# ‚ñâ
```
</p></details>

## Dynamically add Drive(s) with BTRFS and RAID

In this section we will go over adding additional drives and configuring RAID. To start we will add 1 additional drive (for a total of 2) and setup `RAID1`, then we will add a 3rd drive and setup `RAID5`

<details><summary><span style="font-weight:bold">CLICK HERE</span> to Dynamically add Drive(s) with BTRFS and RAID</summary><p>

### Understand your existing filesystem
The following commands give you some basic information about the btrfs mount points and the devices they include:

1.  ``` sh
    sudo btrfs fi show
    ```
2.  ``` sh
    findmnt -nt btrfs
    ```

![](assets/driveinfo.png)

### Add a new LUKS Drive

1. Be sure your new drive is attached to the system and verify with `lsblk`
    > If you are using VirtualBox you can create another `10 GB` drive in settings, under **Storage** after shutting down your VM

    ![](assets/newdrive.png)

2. Create partition:
    ``` sh
    sudo parted /dev/sdb
        mklabel gpt
        mkpart primary 1MiB 100%
        print
        quit
    ```

3. Format for LUKS:
    ``` sh
    sudo cryptsetup luksFormat /dev/sdb1
    ```
    > You can either use the same passphrase as `/dev/sda3` or something different

    > If you on on VirtualBox, you may get a `Killed` response with a screen flicker, this means luksFormat failed. Try with `--pbkdf-memory 256` to reduce the required memory ‚Äì not recommended if you can avoid it. 

4. Open your newly created LUKS partition:
   ``` sh
   sudo cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sdb1 sdb1_crypt
   ```

5. Add a line to `btrfs-luks-unlocker.sh` for your new drive so you will be promted to unlock it on reboot:
    ``` sh
    # Add line to `btrfs-luks-unlocker.sh`
    # /sbin/cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sdb1 sdb1_crypt

    # Execute scrip to update
    ~/btrfs-luks-unlocker.sh
    ```
    ![](assets/scriptdriveupdate.png)

6. Add new drive to the `/` BTRFS mount point and configure for `RAID1`:
    ``` sh
    sudo btrfs device add /dev/mapper/sdb1_crypt /
    ``` 

7. Balance the new drive with the existing:</br></br>
    For 2 Drives use `RAID1`:
    ```
    sudo btrfs balance start -dconvert=raid1 -mconvert=raid1 /
    ```

    For 3+ Drives use `RAID5`:
    ``` sh
    sudo btrfs balance start -dconvert=raid5 -mconvert=raid1 /
    ```
8. Monitor balance status:
    ``` sh
    sudo btrfs balance status /
    ```

Once completed you should have a nice multi-drive setup üëè.
